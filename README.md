This project was part of the undergraduate course TEL 412 that took place
in the Technical University of Crete School of Electrical and Computer
Engineering. The goal of the project was to coordinate the movement of 2-4
cars in the 2-D plane in order to create specific shapes. In order to
achieve that goal we used a camera for the car localization, the Silicon
Laboratories microcontroller C8051F320 with the embedded radio Texas
Instruments CC2500 (nodes) for matlab to master node serial communication
and master node to the car-slave nodes communication.
